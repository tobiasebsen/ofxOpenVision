=============

An openFrameworks addon that simplifies the use of fragment shaders for image processing.

The idea is to provide a framework that will allow you to substitute CPU-intensive algorithms with GPU-optimized shaders for image processing routines. Using GLSL frament shaders you will be able to perform wast amount of processing without using up CPU-power. This is crutial to Computer Vision and other tasks that require real-time processing of pixels.
